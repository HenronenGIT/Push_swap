# Push_swap - Because Swap_push isn’t as natural

<p align="left"><img src="./README/pics/score.png" height="150" /></p>

> <em> This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting. </em>

## How to use

We start by compiling our two programs `checker` and `push_swap`. Simply run:\
`make`

### push_swap

1. `push_swap` program takes integers as an argument.\
With given arguments `push_swap` program returns all operations what it used to sort the stack to ascending order.\
Here is an example how to run program correctly.\
`./push_swap <random set of integers>`\
`./push_swap 1 5 3 4 0`

Arguments has to be:

- Integers
- Seperated with spaces
- In digit format
- There cannot be dublicates

Otherwise you get an `Error` message

### checker

1. `checker` takes integers as an argument as well.\
`./checker <set of integers>`

2. After running `checker` program with set of integers terminal will wait instructions.
